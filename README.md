<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
    A game in which the player has to correctly guess the answer.<br/>
    For example, the secret word is <b><q>apple</q></b> when the player knows the secret word,<br/>
    he will win otherwise he has five times or that depends on 
    players in-game but<br/> I choose five times only to guess the secret word.

    Now play the guessing game with me and tell me what is the secret word. &#x1F60A;<br/>
